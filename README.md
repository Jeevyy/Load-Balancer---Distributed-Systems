# Load-Balancer - Distributed-Systems
### This repository contains the implementation of a load balancer using Docker, aimed at efficiently distributing requests among several servers. The load balancer routes requests from multiple clients asynchronously to ensure nearly even distribution of the load across the server replicas.

## Task Description
### Task One
1. Implement a load balancer that routes requests among several servers asynchronously.
2. Use Docker to manage the deployment of the load balancer and servers within a Docker network.
3. Implement a simple web server in Python to handle HTTP requests on specified endpoints (/home and /heartbeat).
4. Use consistent hashing data structure for efficient request distribution.
5. Ensure fault tolerance by spawning new replicas of servers in case of failures.
6. Write clean and well-documented code, along with a README file detailing design choices, assumptions, testing, and performance analysis.
7. Provide a Makefile for deploying and running the code, and version control the project using Git.
